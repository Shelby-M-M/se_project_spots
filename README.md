# Project 3 Spots

Spots is a mock app designed so users can add profiles about themselves and their favorite spots. These images are designed to be shared and liked by other users. This app is responsive so it is easily accesible on computers, tablets, or phones.

### Technologies and techniques used

- HTML
- CSS
- BEM formating
- Flexbox
- Devtools
- Grid
- Figma
- Adaptive Design
- Images

**HTML**

Independently used HTML formating to create the flow for the Spots webpage.

**CSS**

All styles were applyed to CSS for better organization. Blocks were assigned assigned their own css document to better track styles that were placed in the HTML document.

**BEM**

All items were sectioned into blocks and elements according to BEM formating and placed together in the index.html file.

**Flexbox**

Flexbox allowed me to be more creative when designing the webpage. The structures are able to be pushed into more places and makes the webpage more responsive when changing demensions. Even though exact pixel sizes were used in some cases, many of the structues were able to adjust themselves when the screen size changed.

**Grid**

Grid was used to make the number of images in a row fit within different screen sizes without adding to much extra code. In other words, the number of images in a row is determined by the size of the screen. Using grids repeat autofit property makes the app more adaptable than just using flexbox.

**Devtools**

Devtools allowed me to view how the objects interacted with each other once the screen sizes started to change, which styles were being applied to which items, and see in pixels if the amount of spacing between items matches what was shown in Figma.

**Figma**

Images and Logo were exported directly off of Figma. Distances between items and fonts were viewed on Figma and compared with the project on Devtools.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
